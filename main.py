# Let's try and make Counter till the end of term

# Ideas (Read: Let's make it unnecessarily complicated)
# Store term dates in file, say spreadsheet, and pull from there? (allowing for easy changing each year by staff) - Done (NOW RETURNING MONTHS AS A NUMERICAL VALUE! HOORAY!)
# When not a term, state when the next term starts?
# State how many days before end of last term?

# For getting current date:
import datetime
current = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)
today = datetime.date.today()
year = current.year
month = current.month
day = current.day
hour = current.hour
minute = current.minute
second = current.second
# import module for reading the spreadsheet:
import xlrd
workbook = xlrd.open_workbook(r'Term Dates.xlsx')
worksheet = workbook.sheet_by_name('Term Dates')

# Find way to convert month to number from 1-12 - list.index() function:
monthlist = ["Don't want index() returning 0 so here's a placeholder", "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]

# Variable for denoting if term or break (and which) - I have a hunch I'll need these later:
term = 0
notterm = 0

days = 0

# Current year's terms (pulled from excel file using xlrd module):
# Term 1:
t1daystart = worksheet.cell(2, 1).value
t1monthstart = monthlist.index(worksheet.cell(2,2).value)
t1yearstart = worksheet.cell(2, 3).value
t1dayend = worksheet.cell(2, 4).value

# Term 2:
t2daystart = worksheet.cell(3, 1).value
t2monthstart = monthlist.index(worksheet.cell(3,2).value)
